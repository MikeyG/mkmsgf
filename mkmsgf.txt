       Short Description: Make Message File Utility (MKMSGF) clone and decompiler
        Long Description: For fun I pulled up this old project of mine from 2008
                          to fix bugs. I also added a decompiler which seems to 
                          work. 
      Proposed directory
           for placement: /pub/os2/util/system
