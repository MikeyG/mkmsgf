REX0003H: EXPLANATION: The REXX program could not be read from the disk.
ACTION: Verify file's existence and make sure no other process
        has it locked.
REX0004H: EXPLANATION: The system interrupted the execution of your program
             because of an error or a user request.
ACTION: Trap interrupts via CALL ON HALT or SIGNAL ON HALT.
REX0005H: EXPLANATION: While trying to execute a program, the language
             processor was unable to get the resources it needed
             to continue. For example, it could not get the space
             needed for its work areas or variables. The program
             that called the language processor might itself have
             already used up most of the available storage.  Or a
             request for storage might have been for more than the
             implementation maximum.
ACTION: None
REX0006H: EXPLANATION: A comment or literal string was started but never finished.
             This could be because the language processor detected:
             .    - The end of the program (or the end of the string in an
             .      INTERPRET instruction) without finding the ending "*/" for
             .      a comment or the ending quotation mark for a literal string
             .    - The end of the line for a literal string.
ACTION: None
REX0007H: EXPLANATION: At least one WHEN construct (and possibly an OTHERWISE clause)
             is expected within a SELECT instruction.  This message is
             issued if any other instruction is found or there is no WHEN
             construct before the OTHERWISE or all WHEN expressions are
             false and an OTHERWISE is not present. A common cause of
             this error is if you forget the DO and END around the list
             of instructions following a WHEN.
             For example:
             .    WRONG                  RIGHT
             .    Select                 Select
             .      When a=c then          When a=c then DO
             .    Say 'A equals C'       Say 'A equals C'
             .    exit                   exit
             .    Otherwise nop            end
             .    end                    Otherwise nop
             .    end
ACTION: Look for any instruction other than WHEN (or for any
        missing WHEN construct before the OTHERWISE) in the
        SELECT construct.
REX0008H: EXPLANATION: A THEN or an ELSE clause was found that does not match
             a corresponding IF or WHEN clause. This often occurs
             because of a missing END or DO...END in the THEN part
             of a complex IF...THEN...ELSE construction. For example:
             .    WRONG                     RIGHT
             .    If a=c then do;           If a=c then do;
             .    Say EQUALS                Say EQUALS
             .    exit                      exit
             .    else                        end
             .    Say NOT EQUALS            else
             .    Say NOT EQUALS
ACTION: Look for a missing END or DO...END in the THEN part
        of a complex IF...THEN...ELSE construction.
REX0009H: EXPLANATION: A WHEN or OTHERWISE was found outside of a SELECT
             construction.  You might have accidentally enclosed
             the instruction in a DO...END construction by
             leaving out an END, or you might have tried to branch
             to it with a SIGNAL instruction (which does not work
             because the SELECT is then ended).
ACTION: None
REX0010H: EXPLANATION: More ENDs were found in your program than DO or SELECT
             instructions, or the ENDs did not match the DO or
             SELECT instructions.
             This message also occurs if you try to transfer control
             into the middle of a loop using SIGNAL. In this case,
             the language processor does not expect the END because
             it did not process the previous DO instruction. Remember
             also that SIGNAL deactivates any current loops, so it
             cannot transfer control from one place inside a loop to
             another.
             Another cause for this message is placing an END
             immediately after a THEN or ELSE subkeyword or specifying
             a name on the END keyword that does not match the name
             following DO. Putting the name of the control variable on
             ENDs that close repetitive loops can also help locate this
             kind of error.
ACTION: None
REX0011H: EXPLANATION: Your program exceeds the nesting level limit for control
             structures (for example, DO...END and IF...THEN...ELSE).
             This could be because of a looping INTERPRET instruction,
             such as:
             .    line='INTERPRET line'
             .    INTERPRET line
             These lines loop until they exceed the nesting level
             limit and the language processor issues this message.
             Similarly, a recursive subroutine or internal function
             that does not end correctly can loop until it causes
             this message.
ACTION: None
REX0012H: 
REX0013H: EXPLANATION: A character was found outside a literal (quoted)
             string that is not a blank or one of the valid
             alphanumeric and special characters.
ACTION: None
REX0014H: EXPLANATION: At the end of the program or the string for an INTERPRET
             instruction, a DO or SELECT instruction was found
             without a matching END or an IF clause that is not
             followed by a THEN clause.  Putting the name of the
             control variable on each END closing a controlled loop
             can help locate this kind of error.
ACTION: None
REX0015H: EXPLANATION: Hexadecimal strings must not have leading or trailing
             blanks and blanks can only be embedded at byte
             boundaries.  Only the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f
             and A-F are allowed.  The following are valid
             hexadecimal strings:
             .    '13'x
             .    'A3C2 1c34'x
             .    '1de8'x
             Binary strings can have blanks only at the boundaries of
             groups of four binary digits.  Only the digits 0 and 1
             are allowed.  These are valid binary strings:
             .    '1011'b
             .    '110 1101'b
             .    '101101 11010011'b
             You might have mistyped one of the digits, for example,
             typing a letter O instead of the number 0. Or you might
             have used the one-character symbol X or B (the name of
             the variable X or B, respectively) after a literal string
             when the string is not intended as a hexadecimal or binary
             specification. In this case, use the explicit concatenation
             operator (||) to concatenate the string to the value of the symbol.
ACTION: Use the explicit concatenation operator || in situations where
        X or B is intended to represent a variable.
REX0016H: EXPLANATION: A SIGNAL instruction has been executed or an event for
             which a trap was set with SIGNAL ON has occurred, and the
             language processor could not find the label specified.
             You might have mistyped the label or forgotten to include
             it.
ACTION: None
REX0017H: EXPLANATION: A PROCEDURE instruction was encountered at an
             incorrect position.  This could occur because no
             internal routines are active or because the
             PROCEDURE instruction was not the first instruction
             processed after the CALL instruction or function call.
             One cause for this error is dropping through to an
             internal routine, rather than calling it with a CALL
             instruction or a function call.
ACTION: None
REX0018H: EXPLANATION: A THEN clause must follow each REXX IF or WHEN clause.
             The language processor found another clause before it
             found a THEN clause.
ACTION: None
REX0019H: EXPLANATION: A symbol or string was expected after the CALL or
             SIGNAL keywords but none was found. You might have
             omitted the string or symbol or inserted a special
             character (such as a parenthesis).
ACTION: None
REX0020H: EXPLANATION: A symbol is expected after CALL ON, CALL OFF, END,
             ITERATE, LEAVE, NUMERIC, PARSE, SIGNAL ON, or SIGNAL OFF.
             Also, a list of symbols or variable references is
             expected after DROP, EXPOSE, and PROCEDURE EXPOSE. Either
             there was no symbol when one was required or the language
             processor found another token.
ACTION: None
REX0021H: EXPLANATION: A clause such as SELECT or NOP is followed by a
             token other than a comment.
ACTION: None
REX0022H: EXPLANATION: A literal string contains character codes that are not
             valid.  This might be because some characters are not
             possible, or because the character set is extended and
             certain character combinations are not allowed.
ACTION: None
REX0023H: EXPLANATION: A data string (that is, the result of an expression)
             contains character codes that are not valid.
             This might be because some characters are not possible,
             or because the character set is extended and certain
             character combinations are not allowed.
ACTION: None
REX0024H: EXPLANATION: This message is issued when:
             .    - The option on a TRACE instruction or the argument
             .      to the built-in function does not start with
             .      A, C, E, F, I, L, N, O, or R.
             .    - In interactive debugging, you entered a number
             .      that is not a whole number.
ACTION: None
REX0025H: EXPLANATION: An unexpected token was found at his position of
             an instruction where a particular subkeyword was
             expected. For example, in a NUMERIC instruction,
             the second token must be DIGITS, FUZZ, or FORM.
ACTION: None
REX0026H: EXPLANATION: An expression was found that did not evaluate to a whole
             number or is greater than the limit (the default is
             999 999 999):
             .    - The positional patterns in parsing templates (including
             .      variable positional patterns)
             .    - The operand to the right of the power operator
             .    - The values of exprr and exprf in the DO instruction
             .    - The values given for DIGITS or FUZZ in the NUMERIC
             .      instruction
             .    - The number used in the option of the TRACE setting
             This error is also raised if the value is not permitted (for
             example, a negative repetition count in a DO instruction), or
             the division performed during an integer divide or
             remainder operation does not result in a whole number.
ACTION: None
REX0027H: EXPLANATION: A syntax error was found in the DO instruction.  You
             probably used BY, TO, FOR, WHILE, or UNTIL twice,
             used a WHILE and an UNTIL, or used BY, TO, or FOR when
             there is no control variable specified.
ACTION: None
REX0028H: EXPLANATION: A LEAVE or ITERATE instruction was found at an incorrect
             position.  Either no loop was active, or the name
             specified on the instruction did not match the control
             variable of any active loop.
             Note that internal routine calls and the INTERPRET
             instruction protect DO loops by making them inactive.
             Therefore, for example, a LEAVE instruction in a subroutine
             cannot affect a DO loop in the calling routine.
             You probably tried to use the SIGNAL instruction to
             transfer control within or into a loop. Because a SIGNAL
             instruction ends all active loops, any ITERATE or LEAVE
             instruction causes this message.
ACTION: None
REX0029H: EXPLANATION: The environment name specified on the ADDRESS instruction
             is longer than permitted for the system under which the
             interpreter is running.
ACTION: None
REX0030H: EXPLANATION: A variable name, label name, literal (quoted) string
             has exceeded the allowed limit of 250 characters.
             The limit for names includes any substitutions. A
             possible cause of this error is if you use a period (.)
             in a name, causing an unexpected substitution.
             Leaving off an ending quotation mark for a literal
             string, or putting a single quotation mark in a string,
             can cause this error because several clauses can be
             included in the string. For example, write the string
             'don't' as 'don't' or "don't".
ACTION: None
REX0031H: EXPLANATION: A variable was found whose name begins with a numeric
             digit or a period.  You cannot assign a value to such
             a variable because you could then redefine numeric
             constants.
ACTION: None
REX0032H: 
REX0033H: EXPLANATION: The result of an expression was found not to be
             valid in the context in which it was used.
ACTION: Check for an illegal FUZZ or DIGITS value in a NUMERIC
        instruction. FUZZ must not become larger than DIGITS.
REX0034H: EXPLANATION: An expression was found in an IF, WHEN, DO WHILE,
             or DO UNTIL phrase that did not result in a 0 or 1.
             Any value operated on by a logical operator must
             result in a 0 or 1. For example, the phrase
             If result then exit rc
             fails if result has a value other than 0 or 1.
ACTION: None
REX0035H: EXPLANATION: An expression contains a grammatical error. Possible causes:
             .    - An expression is missing when one is required
             .    - You ended an expression with an operator
             .    - You specified, in an expression, two operators next to
             .      one another with nothing in between them
             .    - You did not specify a right parenthesis when one was
             .      required
             .    - You used special characters (such as operators) in an
             .      intended character expression without enclosing them
             .      in quotation marks
ACTION: Check for special characters (such as operators) in an
        intended character expression that are not enclosed
        in quotes.
REX0036H: EXPLANATION: A matched parenthesis or bracket was found within
             an expression. There are more left parentheses
             than right parentheses or more left brackets
             than right brackets. To include a single parenthesis
             in a command, enclose it in quotation marks.
ACTION: None
REX0037H: EXPLANATION: Either a comma was found outside a function
             invocation, or there are too many right parentheses
             or right square brackets in an expression. To include
             a comma in a character expression, enclose it in
             quotation marks.  For example, write the instruction:
             Say Enter A, B, or C
             as follows:
             Say 'Enter A, B, or C'
ACTION: None
REX0038H: EXPLANATION: A special character that is not allowed within
             a parsing template (for example, "%") has been
             found, or the syntax of a variable pattern is incorrect
             (that is, no symbol was found after a left parenthesis).
             This message is also issued if you omit the WITH
             subkeyword in a PARSE VALUE instruction.
ACTION: None
REX0039H: EXPLANATION: The expression is too complex to be evaluated by the
             language processor.
             ACTION: Check for too many nested parentheses, functions, etc.
ACTION: None
REX0040H: EXPLANATION: An incorrect call to a routine was found. Possible causes:
             .    - You passed incorrect data (arguments) to the built-in
             .      or external routine.
             .    - You passed too many arguments to the built-in, external,
             .      or internal routine.
             .    - The external routine called was not compatible with the
             .      language processor.
             If you did not try to call a routine, you might have a
             symbol or a string adjacent to a "(" when you meant it to
             be separated by a blank or other operator. The language
             processor would treat this as a function call.  For example,
             write TIME(4+5) as follows: TIME*(4+5)
ACTION: None
REX0041H: EXPLANATION: A term in an arithmetic expression is not a valid
             number or has an exponent outside the allowed range
             of -999 999 999 to +999 999 999.
             You might have mistyped a variable name, or included
             an arithmetic operator in a character expression
             without putting it in quotation marks.
ACTION: None
REX0042H: EXPLANATION: The result of an arithmetic operation requires
             an exponent that is greater than the limit of
             nine digits (more than 999 999 999 or less than
             -999 999 999).
             This error can occur during the evaluation of an
             expression (often as a result of trying to divide
             a number by 0) or while stepping a DO loop control
             variable.
ACTION: None
REX0043H: EXPLANATION: A function has been invoked within an expression
             or a subroutine has been invoked by a CALL, but
             it cannot be found. Possible reasons:
             .    - The specified label is not in the program
             .    - It is not the name of a built-in function
             .    - The language processor could not locate it externally
             Check if you mistyped the name.
             If you did not try to call a routine, you might have
             put a symbol or string adjacent to a "(" when you meant
             it to be separated by a blank or another operator.
             The language processor then treats it as a function call.
             For example, write the string 3(4+5) as 3*(4+5).
ACTION: None
REX0044H: EXPLANATION: The language processor called an external
             routine within an expression.  The routine seemed
             to end without error, but it did not return data
             for use in the expression.
             You might have specified the name of a program that
             is not intended for use as a REXX function. Call
             it as a command or subroutine instead.
ACTION: None
REX0045H: EXPLANATION: A REXX program has been called as a function, but
             returned without passing back any data.
ACTION: None
REX0046H: EXPLANATION: Within an ARG, DROP, EXPOSE, PARSE, PULL, or PROCEDURE
             instruction, the syntax of a variable reference (a
             variable whose value is to be used, indicated by its
             name being enclosed in parentheses) is incorrect. The
             right parenthesis that must immediately follow
             the variable name might be missing or the variable
             name might be misspelled.
ACTION: None
REX0047H: EXPLANATION: A label was used in the expression being
             evaluated for an INTERPRET instruction or
             in an expression entered during interactive
             debugging.
ACTION: Remove the label from the interpreted data.
REX0048H: EXPLANATION: The language processor stopped processing the
             program because a system service, such as stream
             input or output or the manipulation of the
             external data queue, has failed to work correctly.
